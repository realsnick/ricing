    [x] add rk3588 support to sky360 nixos
        https://github.com/ryan4yin/nixos-rk3588/blob/main/demo/flake.nix
        [x] setup serial port for debugging.

## open bugs

[x] swap parition
[x] laptop doesn't boot - btrfs waiting for device
    - was missing boot.initrd.availableKernelModules lol
[x] unable to deploy new configuration due to SSH KEY 
    ### Uploading install SSH keys ###

- [-] recover deleted partitions

    - sudo testdisk /dev/nvme1n1p1 - recover partitions
    - foremost -i /dev/nvme1n1p1 - recover files


[x] nix-shell -p testdisk fails 
    error: file 'nixpkgs' was not found in the Nix search path (add it using $NIX_PATH or -I)

    fix: run 
        ```bash
        sudo nix-channel --update
        ```
