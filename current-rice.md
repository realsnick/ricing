## notes

need to fix DMCA Music on twitch...

for udev rules this is the option. 

require the user of the package to add the following line in configuration.nix

```nix
services.udev.packages = [ pkgs.qhyccd_sdk ];
```

- [x] nix switch case statement 
  
  ```nix
     sytem =
      {
        aarch64-linux = "Arm64";
        x86_64-linux = "linux64";
      }
      .${stdenv.system}
      or (throw "Unsupported system: ${stdenv.system}");
  
  ```

# issues

- [x] /sbin/fxload not found/installed 
  
  fixed substituteInPlace --replace

- [x] ldconfig: Can't create temporary cache file /nix/store/lqz6hmd86viw83f9qll2ip87jhb7p1ah-glibc-2.35-224/etc/ld.so.cache~: Permission denied
  
  this is related to not running udev rules... 

- [x] stylix - broken due to fonts

- [x] hyprland broken - error: attribute 'gcc13Stdenv' missing
  
  this is due update the local flake with recent nixpkgs which seems broken...will investigate this issue
  
  [error: attribute 'gcc13Stdenv' missing Â· Issue #92 Â· hyprwm/xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland (github.com)](https://github.com/hyprwm/xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland/issues/92)

- [x] /sbin/fxload is called in udev rules but is not executable or does not exist
  
  had to patch the udev rules files to find fxload in nix store

- [x] /bin/sleep is called in udev rules but is not executable or does not exist

- [x] camera firmware isn't being uploaded - udev rules issue
  
  more patched to the udev-rules, looks like the qhy ccd has a built in fxload that has different parameters then the libusb1 fxload (-d on libusb1 required vendor:product, -D on qhyccd sdk requires -D DEVNAME)
